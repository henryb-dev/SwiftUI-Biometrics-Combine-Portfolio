# SwiftUI + Biometrics + Combine – Secure Portfolio Demo

A clean, modern iOS app showcasing the power of **SwiftUI**, **Biometric Authentication** (Face ID / Touch ID), and **Combine** for reactive programming.

This project doubles as a **personal portfolio piece** and a **practical reference** for developers building secure, reactive apps with Apple's latest frameworks.

Perfect for learning modern Swift development.

## ✨ Features

- Fully declarative UI with **SwiftUI**
- Secure **Face ID / Touch ID** authentication
- Reactive state management using **Combine**
- Protected content (portfolio) revealed only after authentication
- Smooth error handling and user feedback
- Clean MVVM architecture
- Zero third-party dependencies
